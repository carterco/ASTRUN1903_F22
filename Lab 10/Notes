Notes on this lab:

In the future, I would find a way to encourage students to start these sooner (and also come
to me for clarification). I think a lot of presentations were rushed, though everyone did a 
good job using their paper reading skills to identify the key aspects of each study. I emphasized
to each student that reading papers like these may be a little harder than an astrobites article,
but it is totally acessible to them with some time and effort!
