Notes on this lab:

This lab was a modified convection lab -- I wanted to link convection explicitly with stars,
so I included a section on the star Betelgeuse. There is an excellent "Cool Worlds" lecture
by David Kipping that we watched together in class. Students really enjoyed this! I also had 
them explore a simulation that illustrated how temperature drives convection at a particle-
level. The rest of the lab allowed students to get some hands-on experience for convection.
I tried to emphasize that this "small-scale" convection that we were playing with in lab
also drives the funky behavior observed on Betelgeuse, and in general the granulation cells
we observe on all stars. Students enjoyed this lab, but we ran out of time to finish some of 
the hand-on activities at the end... Note: Students may not get your Beetlejuice jokes...
