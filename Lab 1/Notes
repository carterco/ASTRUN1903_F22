Notes on this lab:

I shortend the order of magnitude lab to include a class exercise where I had students fill out a social identity wheel. 
I followed activity guidlines provided by Univeristy of Michigan's Inclusive Teaching website:
https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/inclusive-teaching/social-identity-wheel/ 

After the exercise, we discussed why we should consider identity in the classroom. We then discussed norms, and how we 
could use them to ensure our class was respectful and inclusive. We drafted class norms as a class, which were posted
online on our CourseWorks page. I think this activity went really well!

I got a lot of positive feedback on the social idenity wheel, and students were pleased that we took a moment to share
and discuss parts of our identities that often felt ignored in the classroom. As an instructor, it was also a valuable
excercise to help me learn about how I could be support each student. 

The order of magnitude exercises were sufficiently challenging for all of the class. Students worked in loose pairs, and
we did some board work when examples were useful.
