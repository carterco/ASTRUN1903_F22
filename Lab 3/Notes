Notes on this lab:

For this lab, I modified an existing exoplanets lab. Students get to learn about exoplanets by 
(1) watching a Crash Course lecture, (2) exploring an exoplanet simulation, (3) reading two
exoplanet astrobites articles and recording questions they would ask an "expert", and (4) if 
they had time, practicing identification of exoplanets in transit data for a citizen science
project. 

In a later class, I conducted a Q&A with a gradauate student "expert" in exoplanets (Benjamin 
Cassese) using the questions collected from this class. Students were very excited to ask Ben
their questions! This lab was probably the "favorite" of the most students. I liked that it 
provided multiple ways for students to learn and explore information about exoplanets.
