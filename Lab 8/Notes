Notes on this lab:

For this lab, it is valuable to clarify to students the meaning of theory in the context of science, 
and theory colloquially. This lab was a slightly modified version of an older lab. We discussed section
2 as a class with some board work. Note some trigger warnings in the Carl Sagan reading -- honestly, I 
think we could have skipped it. Students struggled a bit with the math in the homeopathy section, so 
we ended up going over some if it together at the end of class. I emphasised to students that even though
some of these calculations were tricky, all of them could do it with a bit of time and effort. And
that this could save them their money and health when it comes to evaluating pseudoscientific claims!
