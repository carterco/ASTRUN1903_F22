Notes on this lab:

I really wanted to do a 2-part programming lab -- this is the 1st part, which walks students through
coding in Python using Collab notebooks. Unfortunately, I was very sick this week, so I had to adjust 
my plans. I incorporated more videos, and help the lab remotely. I had students join my Zoom room as
they worked on their notebooks, so I could answer any questions. 

I was happy to hear from several students that they were surprised they actually had fun coding 
during this lab. There was defintely some skepticism at the beginning of the lab, particularly from
those who had never written code before. For the few students who had done some coding before, this 
lab was a little too easy. 

I struggled to write the 2nd part of this lab, an applied coding for astronomy notebook, during the 
semester. I wish I had gotten this done, since this lab alone was more an introduction, and didn't
touch on coding applications in astronomy. Alas, due to time constraints, I found this to be a bit
too difficult to create the exercise notebook + lab on my own for a 2nd part.
