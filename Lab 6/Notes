Notes on this lab:

At the beginning of the lab, I had students brainstorm what they knew about the Sun on the 
whiteboard, as a class. By the time I had collected a fact from each person, they were 
running out of things to say. I made a point that this was normal, but a little strange that
the average person doesn't actually know much about the Sun!

Warning -- part 3 of this lab (using the Sun Lab) didn't work for us. Instead, I had them
choose one Sun-related astrobite to read out of a few pre-selected choices. I asked them to
pay careful attention to the research process (not result) of the study, and think about how
they could incorporate an aspect of it into their project. 

At the end of the lab, I had them repeat the exercise of brainstorming what they knew to be
important about the Sun. Of course, there was a huge improvement in answers, which was nice
to contrast with what they intially came up with. This was a 2-part lab -- students used this 
lab to build some foundational knowledge about the Sun before undertaking a "mini-project".

TA guidance is key to make sure each group chooses an appropriate topic and doesn't get too stuck!

Overall, I thought both Sun labs went well (despite the technical hiccup). Students enjoyed
working together on the mini-projects. The next lab was completely dedicated to giving them
time to work on their mini-project, and for presentations of their research question, process,
and findings.
